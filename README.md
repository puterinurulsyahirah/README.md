## Soft-Skills :

### ‚≠ê Problem-Solving

Problem-solving is one of the most crucial soft skills needed by a programmer. Throughout my studies, I joined lots of activities to gain experience and improve my problem-solving skills as well as my critical thinking skills, which are highly important in solving real-life problems. For example, I once joined a programming competition using the Java language during matriculation. Through the competition, I learned how to break down complex problems into small pieces of work. I also learned how to solve the given problem creatively using a simple yet effective solution. In the future, I wish to participate in more programming competitions in various programming languages, such as C++, which I learned this semester. By taking this initiative, I believe that I could enhance my problem-solving skills, which are important in facing real-time situations in my future career. In addition, I could also improve my understanding of lots of programming languages by learning how to solve problems using them during each competition. In short, problem-solving skills are significant for being able to think outside the box to solve problems.

### ‚≠ê Attention To Detail

Attention to detail is also one of the key skills that are sought by employers when recruiting a programmer. Throughout my studies, I also joined activities to boost my focus so I could pay 100% attention to details when doing work, especially coding. For instance, I once joined a hydraulic rocket competition during matriculation. Through the competition, I learned the importance of every small detail of the rocket and how each of those small details would have a big impact on the whole operation of the rocket. This situation is also related to coding. For example, each line of code has small details like a single punctuation that could turn the whole programme into a different purpose, or in the worst-case scenario, lots of syntax errors, which are nightmares for programmers. Attention to detail skills not only could prevent this problem but also help in producing a more neat and smoother system, as small mistakes that are ignored could turn into a big, massive problem that is harder to solve.

### ‚≠ê Communication

Communication is also a paramount skill needed as a programmer. Throughout my studies, I also took part as a crew in some programmes held by schools, colleges, and universities. For example, I was one of the activity crews of Majlis Sambutan Lawatan Okayama Sozan High School, Japan, as well as Nihon University and Secondary High School, Japan, during secondary school. Through both experiences, I learned how to effectively communicate with students from Japan, even with a high language barrier, by handling the programme two years in a row. In the future, I wish to participate more as a crew in programmes that will be held by the university throughout my degree journey. I believe that communication skills are important in my future career, as I will definitely work with other people and in a team in the future. Besides, these skills were significant not only to help boost my teamwork skills but also to help me learn how to deliver information effectively to other people using the best approach based on different situations.

## Hard-Skills :

### ‚≠ê Data Structures & Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms skills are crucial for a programmer. Throughout my studies, I learned how data structures and algorithms play a significant role in my day-to-day work in this field. This is because these skills are highly used when considering the best approach for given problems, which includes the best data structures and algorithms. For instance, I learned how I could use data structures like arrays to store data of the same type rather than lots of different variables. This approach not only makes the code simpler but also saves the memory of the compiler. Besides, I also learned how I need to make my algorithm clear and easy to understand by non-programmer.

### ‚≠ê Object-Oriented Programming ( OOP ) Languages

Object-oriented programming ( OOP ) languages are also one of the key skills as a programmer. During matriculation, I was exposed to one of the OOP languages, which is Java in the Computer Science subject. This was the first OPP language that I learned, which sparked my interest in learning as many programming languages as possible throughout my studies. During my current semester of degree, I also exposed to other OOP languages, which is C++ in the Programming Technique 1 course. With the basic OOP languages that I got during matriculation, it was easier to learn and understand how C++ works. In the future, I wish to equip myself with other OOP languages like Phyton as well as markup languages like HTML and CSS, which are mainly used in web development.

During my visit to New Academia Learning Innovation ( NALI ) 2023, I interviewed one of the participants, who presented a poster with the title, Programming Resilience Skills Through Competition-Based Learning Using Mobile Robots In Real-Time Software Engineering Course. From the interview session with a software engineering's master's student in charge of the poster, I gathered lots of information about their idea, including what makes their work different and why they wish to implement it more due to its benefits to students. With the target audience of software engineering students, this activity offers a fun way to develop programming resilience skills for them. It involved timing analysis that is mainly used in the mobile robot's operation system and is highly focused on their course. With this approach, students are taught to implement real-life concepts and theories to solve problems using robot software. In addition, this innovation also allows students' programming resilience's level to be identified and polished for real-world contexts as software engineers in the future. In short, the industrial visit provided us with a thorough understanding of why innovations in ICT are significant due to their countless impacts on teaching and learning activities, especially in this massive technology-revolving era.

During the industrial talk by Charity Techworks Sdn Bhd, I was exposed to various positions offered by the company in the technology field. The sharing session was given by six people, which included the Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Yee Soon Tuck, and five other workers from different positions in the company. From the talk, I learned that jobs in Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) play a significant role in our lives, anytime and anywhere. This is because professionals in ICT are important in helping us easily adapt to changes due to the revolving technologies. By having them, we could maintain the latest technology in our everyday lives with a smoother and more efficient system. From the talk, I also gained lots of new knowledge about different positions in the technology field in a company, such as the Charity Techworks Sdn Bhd itself. For instance, I was exposed to jobs like Junior Android Developer, QA Testing Analyst, Junior UI / UX Designer, and Junior Web / API Developer. The talk shared details about each position, including its job scope, technology used, and skills needed to be a professional. During the talk, Mr. Yee also kept mentioning that "paper qualification doesn't mean that we know something." He insisted that we have to work hard to gather as much practical knowledge about technologies as possible. This is because theoretical knowledge doesn't mean anything if we don't know how to implement it in a real-life situation. Other speakers also encouraged us to work on our hard skills as well as our soft skills to secure a good career in this field. In short, the industrial talk provided us with a thorough understanding of different jobs related to ICT and why each of them is important in a company. The talk also provided us with a view on how each position works together as a team to perform a task and produce the best result out of it.

During my visit to UTM Digital and the virtual talk I attended about UTM Digital, I learned a lot of new things about the structure of UTM Digital and its role in UTM. One of the benefits of the visit and talk was that I could learn about two main platforms that are provided by UTM Digital. These two platforms can be accessed by all students using their UTM ID and password. The first one is myUtmPortal which is a website that has all the things we may need to access as students. It includes financial status, course credit and activities joined, course registration information, and much more. The second one is UTMSmart Mobile Application, which can be installed from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. This is an easy-to-access app that is used every day by students because it has features like QR attendance scanner and shuttle bus schedules, as well as some features on the website like financial status. From the visit, I also learned how I can use my UTM ID to access other things, such as the Microsoft 365 Suite. Besides, during the visit to the UTM Data Centre, I learned that they are secured using a firewall and 24 / 7 monitoring to ensure the safety of all personal and private data that is kept there. Visitors are also prohibited from bringing their electronic devices inside to prevent any information leakage from happening. During the visit and talk, it also had an impact on the course outcome due to how I could see UTM Digital's significant role in maintaining good technology access and use for improving the learning and security systems at UTM. The visit and talk also developed my interest in acknowledging and learning about new technologies to keep in line with them, so I could use it to the fullest. In short, the industrial visit provided us with a thorough understanding of why we have to keep up with the newest technology for a better future career in the technology field. This is important because when we have strong and high technology knowledge, we could be more creative in finding ways to solve problems using numerous technology facilities.

I was exposed to countless pieces of knowledge regarding system developers and what parts I need to work on to become one in the future. In the mean time, I need to keep learning and mastering lots of programming languages. For instance, I need to equip myself with Phyton, HTML, and many other programming languages that are mainly used by system developers. Besides, I also have to engage with the technologies and tools used as a system developer. For instance, database / OLAP technologies like Druid and PostgreSQL, visualisation tools like Metabase and Superset, and other ETL / ELT tools. In addition, I also need to work on soft skills such as communication skills, real-life problem-solving skills, and many more. These skills are significant as a future system developer as I will have to work with other people and in a team to produce the best solution for each given problem. In short, the industrial talk provided us with a thorough understanding of why continuous learning and development in all these skills are highly crucial to ensuring that I could be a professional system developer in the next four years.
